# üëã Hi there, I'm Shamikh

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I'm passionate about Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and AI.  
Currently, I'm working on projects involving **data pipelines, model deployment, and MLOps tools**.  
I started my journey in AI/ML in 2023, and since then I‚Äôve been building projects and learning modern tools to sharpen my skills.
